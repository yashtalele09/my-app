# Artwork  

## Description  
"Artwork" is a React application built with TypeScript that allows users to view a table of artwork data fetched from an external API. The project uses the PrimeReact library to display a paginated table and features customizable row selections. The application ensures server-side pagination, meaning data for each page is fetched dynamically from the server. Custom row selections persist across page changes, providing a seamless user experience.

## Features  
- **Server-Side Pagination**: Data is fetched dynamically for each page change.
- **Custom Row Selection**: Users can select rows one by one or all at once.
- **Persistent Row Selection**: The selected rows remain consistent across page changes.
- **PrimeReact DataTable**: A powerful table component with built-in features like pagination, sorting, and selection.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and scalability for the app.
